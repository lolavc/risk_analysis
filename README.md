## [Quantitative risk assessment analysis - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/risk_analysis/blob/main/Risk4gh_251223.pdf)
A quantitative risk assessment analysis was conducted to determine the risk of importing Echinococcus multilocularis (EM) into Great Britain (GB) from dogs returning from a 2-week holiday in France. It is carried out a risk assessment focused on the influence of key parameters: the probability of a dog becoming infected whilst it is on holiday, the probability that dog owners do not treat their dogs before returning to GB and the probability that treatment time is outside the window period, considering a regulation that indicates that treatment must have been given between 24 to 120 hours before re-entering GB.
### Tasks fulfilled:
1. The uncertainties around the parameters were studied.
2. The risk was predicted by calculating the annual risk, the expected number of years between EM importation, and the expected number of infected dogs per year.
3. The sensitivity of the risk assessment to variations in these parameters and their potential impact on disease control measures was tested.
