## [Quantitative Risk Assessment - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/risk_analysis/blob/main/Risk4gh_251223.pdf)
This report details the quantitative risk assessment analysis conducted to evaluate the risk of importing Echinococcus multilocularis (EM) into Great Britain (GB) from dogs returning from a 2-week holiday in France. The analysis focused on key parameters including the probability of a dog becoming infected while on holiday, the likelihood of dog owners not treating their dogs before returning to GB, and the probability that treatment occurs outside the specified window period, considering regulations stipulating treatment between 24 to 120 hours before re-entering GB.

### Tasks Completed:
<b>1. Parameter Uncertainty Study:</b>  
The uncertainties surrounding the key parameters were thoroughly investigated to understand their potential impact on the risk assessment outcomes.

<b>2. Risk Prediction:</b>  
The risk of EM importation was predicted by calculating the annual risk, the expected number of years between EM importations, and the anticipated number of infected dogs per year.

<b>3. Sensitivity Analysis:</b>  
The sensitivity of the risk assessment to variations in the identified parameters was examined to assess their influence on disease control measures and overall risk mitigation strategies.

These tasks collectively aimed to provide insight into the risk of EM importation into GB from dogs returning from France, facilitating informed decision-making regarding disease control measures and preventive actions.
